# SSE-and-AVX-512-Intrinsics

I was learning SSE and AVX 512 Intrinsics in Plymouth University in my computer systems work using C/C++. I was effectively performing assembly on vectors which is far more efficient than normal operations as modern computer architecture can do an assembly operation on the vector at O(1) which is much better than each individual number of the vector. This is occassionally used in computer graphics and game development or compiler optimisation. Very interesting subject indeed.
